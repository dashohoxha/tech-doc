   (Optional) Change Password for System User
   ^^^^^

   In order to change the password used by the
   ``zextras@example.com`` user for the Web access, log in to a
   shell terminal as the ``zextras`` user and execute these two
   commands. The first allows to switch to the ``zextras`` user, with
   the second you actually change the password.

   .. code:: console

      # su - zextras
      # carbonio prov setpassword zextras@example.com newpassword

   Make sure that ``newpassword`` meets good security criteria.

   .. rubric:: The ``zextras`` and ``zextras@example.com`` users

   There is a clear distinction between these two users, which are
   intended to execute different tasks:

   ``zextras``
      This the **unix** account of the administrator and must be
      used to carry out administrative tasks from the command line.

   ``zextras@example.com``
      This is the default administrator user to be used to access
      the Admin UI and manage |product| from the web interface.
